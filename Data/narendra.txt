Narendra Damodardas Modi (Gujarati: [?n??end?? d?mod???d?s ?modi?] (listen); born 17 September 1950)[b] is an Indian politician serving as the 14th and current prime minister of India since May 2014. Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament from Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest serving prime minister from outside the Indian National Congress.

Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary education. He was introduced to the RSS at age eight. He has reminisced about helping out after school at his father's tea stall at the Vadnagar railway station. At age 18, he was married to Jashodaben Modi, whom he abandoned soon after. He first publicly acknowledged her as his wife more than four decades later when required to do so by Indian law, but has made no contact with her since. Modi has asserted he had travelled in northern India for two years after leaving his parental home, visiting a number of religious centres, but few details of his travels have emerged. Upon his return to Gujarat in 1971, he became a full-time worker for the RSS. After the state of emergency was declared by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1975, he went into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.[c]

Modi was appointed chief minister of Gujarat in 2001 due to Keshubhai Patel's failing health and poor public image following the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration has been considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots in which 1044 people were killed, three-quarters of whom were Muslim,[d] or otherwise criticised for its management of the crisis. A Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against him personally.[e] While his policies as chief minister—credited with encouraging economic growth—have received praise, his administration was criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state.[f]

Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election which gave the party a majority in the lower house of Indian parliament, the Lok Sabha, the first time for any single party since 1984. His administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy and reduced spending on healthcare, education, and social welfare programmes. He centralised power by abolishing the Planning Commission and replacing it with the NITI Aayog. He began a high-profile sanitation campaign, controversially initiated a demonetisation of high-denomination banknotes and a transformation of the taxation regime, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. He oversaw the country's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As prime minister, he has received consistently high approval ratings.[12][13][14]

Under Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding.[15][16][g] Following his party's victory in the 2019 general election, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act and three controversial farm laws, which prompted widespread protests and sit-ins across the country, resulting in a formal repeal of the latter. Described as engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics, he remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and handling of the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda.[h]

Early life and education
Narendra Damodardas Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a Gujarati Hindu family of grocers in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat). He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c.?1915–1989) and Hiraben Modi (1923–2022).[28][b][29] His family belonged to the Modh-Ghanchi-Teli (oil-presser) community,[30][31][32] which is categorised as an Other Backward Class by the Indian government.[32][33]

Modi had only infrequently spoken of his family background during his 13 years as chief minister of Gujarat. In the run up to the 2014 national elections, he began to regularly draw attention to his low-ranking social origins and to having to work as a child in his father's tea shop on the Vadnagar railway station platform,[34] a description that the evidence of neighbours does not entirely corroborate.[35][36] Modi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967, where teachers described him as an average student and a keen gifted debater, with interest in theatre.[37] He preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image.[38][39]

When eight years old, Modi was introduced to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and began attending its local shakhas (training sessions). There, he met Lakshmanrao Inamdar, popularly known as Vakil Saheb, who inducted him as a balswayamsevak (junior cadet) in the RSS and became his political mentor.[40] While Modi was training with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda, Bharatiya Jana Sangh leaders who were founding members of the BJP's Gujarat unit in 1980.[41]

In a custom traditional to Narendra Modi's caste, his family arranged a betrothal to a girl, Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, leading to their marriage when she was 17 and he was 18.[42][43] Soon afterwards, he abandoned his bride,[44] and left home, never divorcing her, but the marriage remaining unmentioned in his public pronouncements for many decades.[45] In April 2014, shortly before the national elections that swept him to power, he publicly affirmed that he was married and his spouse was Jashodaben; the couple has remained married, but estranged.[46] Reportedly, their marriage was never consummated, and he kept it a secret because otherwise he could not have become a pracharak in the puritan RSS.[47][48]

Modi spent the ensuing two years travelling across Northern and North-eastern India, though few details of where he went have emerged.[49] In interviews, he has described visiting Hindu ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda: the Belur Math near Kolkata, followed by the Advaita Ashrama in Almora and the Ramakrishna Mission in Rajkot. He remained only a short time at each, since he lacked the required college education.[50] Vivekananda has been described as a large influence in Modi's life.[51]

In the early summer of 1968, Modi reached the Belur Math but was turned away, after which he wandered through Calcutta, West Bengal and Assam, stopping in Siliguri and Guwahati. He then went to the Ramakrishna Ashram in Almora, where he was again rejected, before travelling back to Gujarat via Delhi and Rajasthan in 1968–69. Sometime in late 1969 or early 1970, he returned to Vadnagar for a brief visit before leaving again for Ahmedabad.[52][53] There, he lived with his uncle, working in the latter's canteen at the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation.[54]

In Ahmedabad, Modi renewed his acquaintance with Inamdar, who was based at the Hedgewar Bhavan (RSS headquarters) in the city.[55][56][57] Modi's first known political activity as an adult was in 1971 when he, as per his remarks, joined a Jana Sangh Satyagraha in Delhi led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee to enlist for the battlefield during the Bangladesh Liberation War.[58][59] The Indira Gandhi-led central government disallowed open support for the Mukti Bahini, and Modi says he was put in Tihar Jail for a short period.[60][61][62] After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, he stopped working for his uncle and became a full-time pracharak (campaigner) for the RSS,[63] working under Inamdar.[64] Shortly before the war, Modi took part in a non-violent protest against the Indian government in New Delhi, for which he was arrested (as per his claim); this has been cited as a reason for Inamdar electing to mentor him.[64] Many years later, he would co-author a biography of Inamdar, published in 2001.[65] Modi's claim that he was part of a Satyagraha led to a political war.[61] Applications were filed with the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) under the RTI Act seeking details of his arrest. In reply, the PMO claimed that it maintains official records on Modi only since he took charge as the prime minister in 2014. Despite this claim, the official website of the PMO contains specific information about Modi which dates back to the 1950s.[66][67]

In 1978, Modi received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the School of Open Learning (SOL)[68] at the University of Delhi,[47] graduating with a third class.[69] Five years later, in 1983, he received a Master of Arts degree in political science from Gujarat University, graduating with a first class[70][71] as an external distance learning student.[72] There is a controversy surrounding his educational qualification.[73][74] Replying to an RTI query, the SOL said it did not have any data of students who received a BA degree in 1978.[68] Jayantibhai Patel, a former political science professor of Gujarat University, claimed that the subjects listed in Modi's MA degree were not offered by the university when Modi was studying there.[75][76]

Early political career
In June 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India which lasted until 1977. During this period, known as "the Emergency", many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned.[77][78] Modi was appointed general secretary of the "Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti", an RSS committee co-ordinating opposition to the Emergency in Gujarat. Shortly afterwards, the RSS was banned.[79] Modi was forced to go underground in Gujarat and frequently travelled in disguise to avoid arrest. He became involved in printing pamphlets opposing the government, sending them to Delhi and organising demonstrations.[80][81] He was also involved with creating a network of safe houses for individuals wanted by the government, and in raising funds for political refugees and activists.[82] During this period, he wrote a book in Gujarati, Sangharsh Ma Gujarat (In the Struggles of Gujarat), describing events during the Emergency.[83][84] Among the people he met in this role was trade unionist and socialist activist George Fernandes, as well as several other national political figures.[85] In his travels during the Emergency, he was often forced to move in disguise, once dressing as a monk, and once as a Sikh.[86]

Modi became an RSS sambhag pracharak (regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing its activities in the areas of Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979, he went to work for the RSS in Delhi, where he was put to work researching and writing the RSS' version of the history of the Emergency. He returned to Gujarat a short while later, and was assigned by the RSS to the BJP in 1985. In 1987, he helped organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the party won comfortably; his planning has been described as the reason for that result by biographers.[87][88] After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the party; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role, and Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP's Gujarat unit later in 1987.[89]
